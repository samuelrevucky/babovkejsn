`Goal:` Create order page, user zone, database setup. + Create guest page and log in/register page. (from last week)

`Done:` 
- Set up project with next.js (ed0ee3498e1397fd041d639f6e11fd8b8544d77a)
- Created home page and navbar shared across all other routes (this will have to be further modified when the user zone will be ready). (0ab3a97b8a4bdec36ec52d8c679f7714bdd18704)

`Plans:` At this point I'm just going to try my best to catch up with the schedule. My hopes are that the learning curve will be steeper from now on since I've picked up the basics.

`Problems:` I've had a lot of struggle with wrapping my head around how the Next.js framework works. Then deciding which way of css editing will I choose, I've tried more of them, ended up with Tailwind. And finally, my biggest problem was deciding how I want my home page to look. Unfortunately, this will probably prevail with the rest of my pages.
