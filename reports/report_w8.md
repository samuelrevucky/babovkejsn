`Goal:` Admin interface

`Done:` 
- ead1314 Add sign out and user dropdown menu
- 4e1798a Modify login page and logic
- 10a102a Add authentication

`Plans:` I hope that now that the communication between FE and BE is kinda sorted, I will be able to at least finish everything on the user side before the presentation.

`Problems:` Implementing authentication and signing out took way longer than expected, but at least they work nicely now just using cookies.
